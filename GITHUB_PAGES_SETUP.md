# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Setup Guide

Complete step-by-step guide to host Learning Hub on GitHub Pages for free.

---

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account (free at github.com)
- Git installed on your computer
- The learn-claude files ready to push

---

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name:** `learn-claude`
   - **Description:** "Comprehensive learning platform with study materials"
   - **Visibility:** Public (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **Initialize:** Leave unchecked
3. Click **Create repository**

---

## Step 2: Initialize Git Locally

From your `learn-claude` directory:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/learn-claude

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Learning Hub with 4 subjects and 1,300+ code examples"

# Rename branch to main (GitHub Pages requirement)
git branch -M main
```

---

## Step 3: Connect to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote repository (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/learn-claude.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

You'll be prompted for authentication:
- **Username:** Your GitHub username
- **Password:** Use a Personal Access Token (see note below)

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

If password doesn't work:

1. Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
2. Click "Generate new token"
3. Check `repo` scope
4. Copy the token
5. Use token as password when pushing

---

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/learn-claude`
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. In left sidebar, click **Pages**
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source:** Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch:** Select `main`
   - **Folder:** Select `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**

---

## Step 5: Wait for Deployment

GitHub will deploy your site:

1. You'll see a blue notification: "GitHub Pages is currently being built from the main branch"
2. Wait 1-2 minutes
3. Notification changes to green: "Your site is published at..."

---

## Step 6: Access Your Site

Your Learning Hub is now live at:

```
https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/learn-claude/
```

**Share this URL with others!**

---

## Updating Content

After setup, updating is easy:

```bash
# Make changes to files (create new chapters, etc.)

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new chapter: Advanced React Patterns"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

GitHub automatically deploys within 1-2 minutes! âœ¨

---

## Using a Custom Domain (Optional)

Want `https://yourdomain.com` instead?

1. Buy domain (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Go to repo **Settings â†’ Pages**
3. Under "Custom domain", enter your domain
4. Update DNS settings with your registrar:
   - Point A record to: `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`
   - Point CNAME to: `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pages Not Showing

1. Wait 2-5 minutes for GitHub to build
2. Check **Settings â†’ Pages** shows green checkmark
3. Click the URL to verify it works
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)

### Files Not Loading

1. Check `.gitignore` doesn't exclude your content
2. Verify all folders are committed: `git status`
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Build Failed

1. Go to **Actions** tab to see errors
2. Common issue: Missing `.gitignore` rules
3. Check all file paths are relative (e.g., `./React-TypeScript/notes/...`)

### Custom Domain Issues

1. Verify DNS settings are correct
2. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS to propagate
3. Check certificate status under **Settings â†’ Pages**

---

## Continuous Updates

### Adding New Chapters

```bash
# Create new markdown file
mkdir -p React-TypeScript/notes
echo "# New Chapter" > React-TypeScript/notes/06-advanced-hooks.md

# Update index.html with new file path

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add chapter: Advanced React Hooks"
git push
```

### Fixing Typos

```bash
# Edit file
nano Oracle-SQL/notes/01-sql-fundamentals-and-dml.md

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo in SQL fundamentals chapter"
git push
```

### Monthly Backups

GitHub is your backup! All history is preserved:

```bash
# View history
git log --oneline

# Restore old version if needed
git checkout COMMIT-HASH
```

---

## Sharing Your Learning Hub

Once live, share with:

- **Direct link:** Share URL with friends/colleagues
- **Social media:** Post on LinkedIn, Twitter
- **Resume:** Add to portfolio/CV
- **Study groups:** Share with classmates
- **Online communities:** Post on r/learnprogramming, etc.

---

## Advanced: GitHub Actions (Optional)

Automatically run checks on updates:

Create `.github/workflows/lint.yml`:

```yaml
name: Lint

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Check file structure
        run: |
          test -f index.html
          test -d React-TypeScript
          test -d Java8-Plus
          test -d Spring-Framework
          test -d Oracle-SQL
```

This automatically validates your repository on every push!

---

## Common Git Commands

```bash
# Check status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# See what changed
git diff

# Undo last commit (before push)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Create new branch for features
git checkout -b add-new-subject
git push -u origin add-new-subject

# Merge pull request locally
git pull origin feature-branch
```

---

## Performance Tips

- âœ… **Large files:** Keep markdown files under 100KB
- âœ… **Images:** Optimize and compress before adding
- âœ… **Build time:** Usually 30-60 seconds
- âœ… **Cache:** Visitors' browsers cache content

---

## Security Notes

- âœ… `.gitignore` prevents accidental secrets
- âœ… Public repo means anyone can view/fork (that's okay!)
- âœ… Don't commit passwords, API keys, tokens
- âœ… Use `.gitignore` for sensitive files
