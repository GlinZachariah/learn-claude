## Quick Reference

### Core Concepts

**Lambda Expressions**
```java
(parameters) -> expression
Function<Integer, Integer> square = x -> x * x;
```

**Streams API**
```java
list.stream()
    .filter(condition)
    .map(transform)
    .collect(result);
```

**Optional**
```java
Optional<T> value = Optional.of(data);
value.map(transform).orElse(default);
```

**Records** (Java 14+)
```java
record Person(String name, int age) {}
```

**Pattern Matching** (Java 16+)
```java
if (obj instanceof String str) {
    System.out.println(str.length());
}
```

## Learning Strategies

### Active Learning
1. **Read** the notes carefully
2. **Type** out the code examples
3. **Modify** the examples to experiment
4. **Test** your understanding with questions
5. **Apply** in real problems

### Practice Progression
1. Start with basic questions in `questions/java8-questions.md`
2. Take the `quiz/java8-quiz.md` to gauge understanding
3. Solve problems in `real-problems/coding-problems.md` from basic â†’ advanced
4. Review `interview-questions/java8-interviews.md` for deeper insights

### Using Claude for Learning
Use Claude to:
- **Clarify** concepts you don't understand
- **Debug** your code solutions
- **Explore** edge cases
- **Compare** different approaches
- **Review** your solutions

See the main CLAUDE.md file for how to use Claude effectively.
