## Study Tips & Best Practices

### 1. **Learn Interactively**

Don't just read - code along!

```bash
# Recommended workflow:
# 1. Read a concept
# 2. Understand the theory
# 3. Write code examples
# 4. Run and experiment
# 5. Read production code examples
```

### 2. **Progressive Complexity**

Start with fundamentals, build to advanced topics:

```
Basic → Intermediate → Advanced → Production Patterns
Lambda → Streams → CompletableFuture → Multi-level Caching
```

### 3. **Real-World Context**

Each topic includes practical examples:

- **CompletableFuture:** API aggregation, timeout handling, retry logic
- **Caching:** Database query caching, API response caching, distributed cache
- **Thread Safety:** Concurrent data structures, singleton patterns, race condition prevention
- **Time:** Date calculations, timezone conversions, business hour calculations

### 4. **Benchmark & Measure**

Don't assume - measure!

```java
// Example: Measure cache hit rate
long hits = 1000;
long misses = 50;
double hitRatio = (double) hits / (hits + misses);  // 0.952 = 95.2%
```

### 5. **Study Expert Questions**

The expert section (`expert-architect-questions.md`) covers:
- **System Design:** Multi-level caching for 100K req/s
- **Architecture:** CompletableFuture vs Virtual Threads tradeoffs
- **Patterns:** Circuit breaker with resilience
- **Scalability:** Thread pool sizing formulas
- **Reliability:** Retry policies with exponential backoff

## Key Concepts to Master

### 1. **Functional Programming**
- λ Lambdas make code concise and readable
- Streams enable declarative data processing
- Method references improve clarity

```java
// Imperative
List<String> uppercase = new ArrayList<>();
for (String s : names) {
    uppercase.add(s.toUpperCase());
}

// Functional (better)
List<String> uppercase = names.stream()
    .map(String::toUpperCase)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

### 2. **Asynchronous Processing**
- Blocking I/O wastes resources
- CompletableFuture enables non-blocking operations
- Proper executor management is critical

```java
// Blocking (wastes thread)
String result = fetchData();  // Thread blocks for I/O

// Non-blocking (efficient)
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(
    () -> fetchData(), ioExecutor
);
```

### 3. **Caching**
- Memory is faster than disk/network by orders of magnitude
- Proper invalidation is crucial for consistency
- Monitor hit rates to validate effectiveness

```
No Cache:      100ms/request
With Cache:    1ms/request (in-memory hit)
Hit Rate:      95%
Improvement:   99x faster
```

### 4. **Thread Safety**
- Immutability is the safest option
- Use appropriate synchronization for shared mutable state
- Understand atomic operations vs locks

```
Most Thread-Safe:    Immutable Objects
                     ↓
                     Atomic Variables
                     ↓
                     ReadWriteLock
                     ↓
                     synchronized
Least Thread-Safe:   Unsynchronized Mutable
```

### 5. **Time Handling**
- Use java.time (never java.util.Date)
- Be timezone-aware from the start
- Immutability prevents bugs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Using Old Date/Time APIs
```java
// BAD
Date date = new Date();
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");

// GOOD
LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ISO_LOCAL_DATE;
```

### ❌ Blocking Operations in Thread Pools
```java
// BAD - Blocks thread, wastes resources
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(() -> blockingIOCall());

// GOOD - Non-blocking
ExecutorService ioExecutor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(100);
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> blockingIOCall(), ioExecutor);
```

### ❌ Unbounded Caches
```java
// BAD - Memory leak!
Map<String, Data> cache = new HashMap<>();

// GOOD - Bounded with eviction
Cache<String, Data> cache = Caffeine.newBuilder()
    .maximumSize(1000)
    .build();
```

### ❌ Race Conditions
```java
// BAD - Race condition!
private int count = 0;
public void increment() {
    count++;  // Not atomic
}

// GOOD - Thread-safe
private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();
public void increment() {
    count.incrementAndGet();  // Atomic
}
```

### ❌ Ignoring Thread Safety in Collections
```java
// BAD - Not thread-safe
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

// GOOD - Thread-safe
Map<String, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
List<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### CompletableFuture vs Callbacks

```
Throughput with 1000 concurrent operations:

Callback-based:        ~5,000 ops/sec
CompletableFuture:     ~50,000 ops/sec  (10x better)
Virtual Threads:       ~500,000 ops/sec (100x better)
```

### Caching Impact

```
Cache Hit Rate    Latency    Improvement
    0%           100ms      1x (baseline)
   50%            60ms      1.67x
   95%            15ms      6.67x
   99%             5ms      20x
```

### Thread Pool Sizing

```
16 cores, I/O-bound task (90ms latency):

Pool Size    Throughput    Context Switch Overhead
     16      Low (blocked)       None
     50      Good               ~5%
    160      Excellent          ~15%
   1000      Good               ~40%
   5000      Degraded           ~80%
```
